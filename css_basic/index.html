			Successful students Have Goals
		</h1>
		<p>
			Succeeding in college is rather like succeeding in life. It's much more about you than it is about college.
		</p>
		<h2>
			The most important place to start
		</h2>
		<p>
		    Even if you have already thought about these questions, it's good to reaffirm your commitment to your plan as we begin to consider what's involved in being a college student. Let's take a look at how successful students have goals.
			.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Students who have long-term life and career goals
		</h3>
		<p>
			This can set a purpose and a direction for students. It can increase students' day-to-day and semester-to-semester motivation because they see that each course is part of a greater whole that will help them in the future.
		</p>
		<p>
			This can also help with persistence and keeping at it when things are tough. There will be challenges during your college career. Sometimes, you feel like giving up or not going to class, reading your textbook, or writing that paper. Having that purpose and that long-term goal can help you decide to move past that challenge and keep going. We call this resiliency.
